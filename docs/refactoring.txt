Class-Implementation & Class-Interface Refactoring

- Push creation-of-lots process from Auction to LotFactory
    + also push validation of lot numbers (no overlap) from OnlineAuctionSystem to Lotfactory

- Pull placeBid() action from Lot to Bidder
    + also pull validating bidderID from Lot.placeBid() to OnlineAuctionSystem

- Extract checkBid() code to a separate method in Lot for subclasses to override


Recommended Refactoring

- Pull the process of checking all auctions to see which ones are in a
bidder's region outside Bidder class (to OnlineAuctionSystem?)
    -> so Bidder doesn't get access to auctions it shouldn't see

- Create separate Lot interface for non-Bidder classes
    -> so other classes can't access its placeBid() method

- Create seperate BidderWithRegion and AuctionWithRegion subclasses for
Bidder and Auction respectively
    -> to handle special cases, and allow for future flexibility with
    other types of Bidders or Auctions
