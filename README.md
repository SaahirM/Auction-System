# Auction System

My work for an assignment where I needed to implement a few features for, and perform class-level refactoring on, a code base. Given the initial code base and some new requirements, I designed and implemented [a different class hierarchy](https://github.com/SaahirM/Auction-System/blob/bd1671b840f3c1a9c98912066783730cbcaa9381/docs/design.pdf) for this code according to SOLID Design Principles.
